Principles of Natural Justice:
- Right to a fair hearing (audi alteram partem).
- Right to cross-examine witnesses.
- No one should be a judge in his own cause (nemo judex in causa sua).
Key case: Union of India v. T.R. Varma (1958): Natural justice requires opportunity to adduce evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
