Judicial review in service matters:
- Courts/tribunals may review disciplinary proceedings only for procedural irregularity, violation of natural justice, or lack of evidence.
- Adequacy or proportionality of penalty is not ordinarily open to review unless it is grossly disproportionate or arbitrary.
Key cases: State of Orissa v. Bidyabhushan (1963), Union of India v. Tulsiram Patel (1985).
